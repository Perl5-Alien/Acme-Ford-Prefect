NAME
    Acme::Alien::DontPanic - Test Module for Alien::Base

DESCRIPTION
    Alien::Base comprises base classes to help in the construction of
    "Alien::" modules. Modules in the Alien namespace are used to locate and
    install (if necessary) external libraries needed by other Perl modules.

    This module is a toy module to test the efficacy of the Alien::Base
    system. This module is depended on by another toy module
    Acme::Ford::Prefect, which needs the libdontpanic library to be able to
    tell us the "answer".
